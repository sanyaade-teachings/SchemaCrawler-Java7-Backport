SchemaCrawler is a free database schema discovery and comprehension tool. SchemaCrawler has a good mix of useful features for data governance. SchemaCrawler is also a Java API that makes working with database metadata as easy as working with plain old Java objects.

All SchemaCrawler jars are in the [Central Repository](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3Aus.fatehi%20a%3Aschemacrawler*). They can be used as dependencies in [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) or [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) projects, or with any other build system that supports the Central Repository.
